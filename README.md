# Rmux #

Rmux is a Redis connection pooler and multiplexer, written in Go.  

## Installing ##

- Install [Go](http://golang.org/doc/install) 
- go get -u github.com/Pardot/rmux
- go build -o /usr/local/bin/rmux github.com/Pardot/rmux/main


## Usage ##

```
Usage of rmux:
  -host="localhost": The host to listen for incoming connections on
  -localReadTimeout=0: Timeout to set locally (read)
  -localTimeout=0: Timeout to set locally (read+write)
  -localWriteTimeout=0: Timeout to set locally (write)
  -maxProcesses=0: The number of processes to use.  If this is not defined, go's default is used.
  -poolSize=50: The size of the connection pools to use
  -port="6379": The port to listen for incoming connections on
  -remoteConnectTimeout=0: Timeout to set for remote redises (connect)
  -remoteReadTimeout=0: Timeout to set for remote redises (read)
  -remoteTimeout=0: Timeout to set for remote redises (connect+read+write)
  -remoteWriteTimeout=0: Timeout to set for remote redises (write)
  -socket="": The socket to listen for incoming connections on.  If this is provided, host and port are ignored
  -tcpConnections="localhost:6380 localhost:6381": TCP connections (destination redis servers) to multiplex over
  -unixConnections="": Unix connections (destination redis servers) to multiplex over
```

Localhost example:
```
redis-server --port 6379 &
redis-server --port 6380 &
redis-server --port 6381 &
redis-server --port 6382 &
rmux -socket=/tmp/rmux.sock -tcpConnections="localhost:6379 localhost:6380 localhost:6381 localhost:6382" &
redis-cli -s /tmp/rmux.sock
```

- All servers running production code should be running the same version of rmux, and should be connecting over the rmux socket
- All key-based commands will hash over ports 6379->6382 on localhost
- Select will always return +OK, even if the server id is invalid
- Ping will always return +PONG
- Quit will always return +OK



Production equivalent:
```
rmux -socket=/tmp/rmux.sock -tcpConnections="redis1:6379 redis1:6380 redis2:6379 redis2:6380"
```

### Disabled commands ###

The following redis commands are disabled, because they should generally be run on the actual redis server that you want information from:
```
bgrewriteaof
bgsave
client
config
dbsize
debug
flushall
flushdb
lastsave
move
monitor
migrate
object
randomkey
save
shutdown
slaveof
slowlog
sync
time
```

The following redis commands are disabled if multiplexing is enabled, because they have the potential to operate on multiple keys:
```
multi
watch
exec
unwatch
discard
eval
bitop
brpoplpush
keys
mget
mset
msetnx
rename
renamenx
rpoplpush
script
sdiff
sdiffstore
sinter
sinterstore
sinter
smove
sunion
sunionstore
zinterstore
zunionstore
```

PubSub support is currently experimental, and only publish and subscribe are supported.
Disabled:
```
psubscribe
pubsub
punsubscribe
unsubscribe
```

### Benchmarks ###

Benchmarks with keep-alive off show rmux being ~4.5x as fast as a direct connection, under heavy load:
```
$ redis-benchmark -q -n 1000 -c 50 -r 50 -k 0 
WARNING: keepalive disabled, you probably need 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse' for Linux and 'sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=1000' for Mac OS X in order to use a lot of clients/requests
